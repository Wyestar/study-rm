/*A magical sub-sequence of a string S is a sub-sequence of S that contains all five vowels in order. Find the length of largest magical sub-sequence of a string S.

For example, if S = aeeiooua, then aeiou and aeeioou are magical sub-sequences but aeio and aeeioua are not.

other test cases:
S = "aeiouaaeeaiioooooieuau" => aaeeiiooooouu is longest subsequence. return 13
*/

// for each vowel, find largest consecutive block
// if they are in order, add lengths
